For small-sized problem, we will consider the accuracy of the approximation algorithm.
Approx-Alg ≥ IP ≥ LP

For larger-sized problem, forget about solving the IP. We will consider the speed in term of wall-clock time. We can still have somewhat of a handle on the accuracy by comparing to the LP.

For the rounding approximation algorithm, there is an inner LP, which at this point we know of two formulations:

1. The book in section 8.3 discusses a exponentially-sized LP and a polynomial time separation oracle. To use this, we need to use the separation oracle as a subroutine of an optimization function. This should be a pretty standard operation using ellipsoid method.
2. In the lecture, we learned a polynomial-sized LP.

One deliverable of our project will be comparing how these two inner LPs perform in term of speed.

We have decided to use Python as our scripting language and Gurobi as the solver, which is available on CAEN machines.

For testing the performance, we will evaluate on
1. Toy examples
2. Synthetic examples
3. Real data (traffic data, power grid data, video object segmentation, social graphs)
